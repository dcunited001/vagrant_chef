Vagrant Chef
============

This is a project that should allow me to easily make new Vagrant Boxes.
I have an Ubuntu 12.04 basebox, where it's easiest to install Chef-Server.

Then I can use this Chef Server Instance to create a few different
Multi-VM environments.  Chef Server is kind of a pain to run on your personal
dev laptop, since it requires a few different services to be installed, like
RabbitMQ, etc.

This will make it easy to pop up the Chef Server when I need it and configure
more efficient Linux Distro's, like Debian or ArchLinux.
